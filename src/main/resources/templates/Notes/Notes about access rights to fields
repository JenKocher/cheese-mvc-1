For each of the following field types, write:

descriptions
an example of a situation where you might use it

To review, consult the lesson on encapsulating data.

public field - "Public" allows a field or method to be used by anyone. The setters and getters for
fields within a user-defined object should be set to public in order to allow access to the
encapsulated data.

private field - "Private" allows a field or method to be used only within the class in which it is defined.
The fields within a user-defined object should be set to private in order to encapsulate the data.

No modifier leaves access to the default of being private within the package, also expressed as
"package-private".

static field - A static field is shared by all instances of the class. It is used when each object doesn't need its
own version of the variable. An example is absolute zero in Farenheit.

final field - final is used with static to create a constant. Constants should be in all-caps with an underscore
 to separate words. Initialize constants where they are declared to prevent someone else from initializing them
 first, and make them public. Absolute zero in Farenheit could be expressed as a constant.
