    <!--Create a form for the user to add a cheese.-->

    <form method="post">

    <!-- Alternatively, you can add an "action" attribute to the form,
    with a URL path within a string (quotes), and that will be the URL that the form will
    be submitted to, like this:
    <form method="post" action="/cheese/new"> -->
        <!-- Alternatively, the form can be submitted to the same URL where the form lives.
        You implement that by leaving off the "action" attribute, having the identical
        URLs be in the two handlers (one for the form and one for processing the form),
        and delineating the two by specifying one as a GET request in the handler and
        one as a POST request in the handler. -->

        <input type="text" name="cheeseName" />
        <input type="submit" value="Add Cheese" />
    </form>
